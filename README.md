# tabby-cpu-image

A community-maintained CPU-only Docker image for [TabbyML Tabby](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby).

## About

This project provides a Docker image for running Tabby with CPU-only support. The official Tabby project currently focuses on GPU-accelerated images, so this repository fills the gap for users who want to run Tabby on CPU-only infrastructure.

**Important:** Enterprise features are not included in this image. Only the Apache 2.0 licensed community edition is built.

> **Note:** This is a community-maintained project and is not officially supported by TabbyML. For the official Tabby project, visit [TabbyML/tabby](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby).
